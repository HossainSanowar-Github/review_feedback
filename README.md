# customer Review feedback on product:

Analyses of customer review feedback are conducted for various items. I used Python libraries such as beautiful soup, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, cloud API (Postman, Azure, Heroku, AWS), HTML, and CSS to get the desired results in this project. Important client input, such as ratings and product names, is provided by a few customers. There are several forms of product-related communications, such as this product is excellent, the colour is great, etc. The collected data is then saved in databases such as MongoDB and SQL for future machine learning and deep learning research. Next phase, I will concentrate more on machine learning and deep learning prediction analysis.
